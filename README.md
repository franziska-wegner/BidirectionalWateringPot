# Bidirectional Outstanding Natural Gardening Tool (BONG)

This is the PhD hat project of Lukas Barth (see https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/members/lukas_barth/index), 
where a bidirectional water can was designed and implemented to water his shoulder or a plant on 
his hat. The water depot was added in the center of his head including a waterpump and some sensors. 
Clapping hands of the audience resulted in a watering of his shoulder hoping that the PhD student will 
grow further in life. 

List of Items:
* Arduino,
* Relay for enabling the waterpump when a certain event happened,
* Waterpump,
* ...
